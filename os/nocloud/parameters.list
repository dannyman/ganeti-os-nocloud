cloud_userdata A comma-separated list of sources to concatenate as the user data. The following sources are supported: "file:<path>" loads the data from a local file at "<path>", where non-absolute paths are relative to "/etc/ganeti/nocloud/user-data". "base64:<data>" inserts the result of base64 decoding "<data>". "line:<text>" inserts "<text>" followed by a newline, e.g. "line:#cloud-config" can be used as the first part if the first real source lacks this header. Finally, various URL schemes will be handled by curl, including http, https, ftp, sftp, tftp, scp. If this parameter is not specified, "file:${OS_VARIANT}.yml" or "file:default.yml" are searched in that order. Note that this simple concatenating only allows composing parts containing disjoint top-level dictionary keys. If you need cloud-init style composition, generate a multipart MIME document and send it as a single part. This also means that any URLs will be fetched by the VM itself.
dns_nameservers A comma-separated list of IP numbers of name servers.
dns_search A comma-separated list of domains to search for incomplete domains.
static_host_interface Set to an interface number, that inteface will be statically configured with all IP numbers reported by DNS for the host name.  This can be used to configure IPv6-only hosts or assign multiple IP numbers on the same interface during cloud-init, as the --net ip option only allows a single IPv4 number.
